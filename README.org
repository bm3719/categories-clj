* categories-clj

This is a demonstration project that will be used to illustrate a few
introductory category theory concepts in Clojure.  It consists of a
presentation and some code

These concepts will be presented at the National Capital Area Clojure Users
Group on 2017-02-08.  See the [[https://www.meetup.com/Cap-Clug/events/236256915/][event page]] for details.

* Usage

The Clojure part of this application is only intended to be used from the REPL.
To run the application use:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
lein repl :headless
#+END_SRC

Then connect to it in Emacs via ~M-x cider-connect~.

There is also a presentation in org-mode (to be used with org-present) in the
=doc/= directory.  Open this file in Emacs and run ~M-x org-present~.  You'll, of
course, need to have installed the org-present package.
